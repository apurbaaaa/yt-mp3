Soon after the superior performance of Wav2Vec2 was demonstrated on one of the most popular English datasets for ASR, called [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr), *Facebook AI* presented a multi-lingual version of Wav2Vec2, called [XLSR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13979) and [XLS-R](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-xlm-r-state-of-the-art-cross-lingual-understanding-through-self-supervision/). XLSR stands for *cross-lingual speech representations* and refers to model's ability to learn speech representations that are useful across multiple languages.\n",

        "In machine learning, [adapters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00751.pdf) are a method used to fine-tune pre-trained models while keeping the original model parameters unchanged. They do this by inserting small, trainable modules, called adapter layers, between the pre-existing layers of the model, which then adapt the model to a specific task without requiring extensive retraining.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adapters have a long history in speech recognition and especially **speaker recognition**. In speaker recognition, adapters have been effectively used to tweak pre-existing models to recognize individual speaker idiosyncrasies, as highlighted in [Gales and Woodland's (1996)](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive_v0/archive_papers/icslp_1996/i96_1832.pdf) and [Miao et al.'s (2014)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ymiao/pub/tasl_sat.pdf) work. This approach not only greatly reduces computational requirements compared to full model, but also allows for better and more flexible speaker-specific adjustments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The work done in **MMS** leverages this idea of adapters for speech recognition across different languages. Adapter weights a fine-tuned to grasp unique phonetic and grammatical traits of each target language. Thereby, MMS enables a single large base model (*e.g.*, the [**`mms-1b-all`**](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mms-1b-all) checkpoint) and 1000+ small adapter layers (2.5M weights each for **`mms-1b-all`**) to comprehend and transcribe multiple languages. This dramatically reduces the computational demand of developing distinct models for each language.\n",
